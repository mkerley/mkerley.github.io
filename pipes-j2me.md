Rotate the pipe segments to connect all the pieces. Features a resizable board, randomly generated puzzles, and auto save and resume. Easy to learn... and yes, every puzzle can be solved.

This is a mobile phone game, not a Windows/Linux/Mac/whatever game. It should work on any J2ME-compatible phone. I have gotten responses from several people (thanks!) with several different phone models that worked. Rather than list them all, I'll just say that I haven't heard of any J2ME-compatible phones that **didn't** work. A few examples of J2ME-compatible phones:

- Blackberry
- Most Windows-based phones
- Many Nokia phones

#### Controls

- Moving the cursor
  - Directional buttons/joystick, or 2/4/6/8 number keys
- Rotating pipes
  - OK button (usually in the middle of the directional buttons), or 1/3 number keys
- Adjusting the difficulty/resizing the board
  - Select "Resize" from the menu
- Zoom in/out (new in version 1.1.2)
  - #/\* buttons

For the easiest installation, point your phone to [mobile.kornhornio.net](http://mobile.kornhornio.net/). If you don't like that, you can always try downloading to your computer and installing over Bluetooth or whatever your phone supports.
