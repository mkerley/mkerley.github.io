I used to customize all the sounds on my Windows Mobile phone (I feel dirty just saying I had one of those) back around ~2006, and I've always wished the iPhone would let me do it. It took a few years, but it finally happened. I'm surprised I haven't seen this new feature mentioned anywhere.

There has always been an option to customize sounds, but it's always sucked... until now. iOS 4 and below only let you turn a lot of the alert sounds on and off, but iOS 5 lets you customize each sound:

<figure style="display:inline-block">
  <img src="/assets/images/2011/10/photo-200x300.png" alt="iOS 4 Sounds Settings" />
  <figcaption>iOS 4: Lame</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure style="display:inline-block">
  <img src="/assets/images/2011/10/IMG_1407-200x300.png" alt="iOS 5 Sounds Settings" />
  <figcaption>iOS 5: Yaaaaaay!</figcaption>
</figure>

And on top of that, you're not limited to the built-in alert sounds! You can finally use any ringtone for any alert sound, whether you purchased it from iTunes or [made it yourself for free](http://audiko.net/). For example, I'm using a [_Saw_ ringtone](/assets/audio/2011/10/Saw.m4r) to celebrate Halloween.

If you'll excuse me, I'm off to download some [free video game ringtones](http://www.mobiles24.com/downloads/free-iphone-ringtones/video-game-music?orderby=popular).

(Edit: I almost forgot to mention you can edit any contact and set their individual text sound as well.)
