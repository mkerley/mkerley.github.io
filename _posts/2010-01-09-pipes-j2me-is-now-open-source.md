I have opened the source to the J2ME version of Pipes. If you're interested in contributing to the project, it's hosted on Github:

[PipesJ2ME on GitHub](http://github.com/mkerley/PipesJ2ME)

Anyone is welcome to submit source code, documentation, translations, etc. directly to Github. I'm putting the source under the GPL license.

Note: The iPhone version of Pipes will remain a separate closed-source project under my personal ownership.
