A number of people have pointed out that my J2ME version of Pipes doesn't work properly on some newer phones (especially those with touch screens, such as the Blackberry Storm). It is also lacking in features compared to my iPhone version.

The fact is I simply don't have the time or resources to maintain the J2ME version. I don't have a J2ME phone anymore, and since I don't make any money from the J2ME verison, I can't justify buying development equipment.

So my question is this: If I were to release the source, would anyone be willing to help out by adding new features?
