Over the weekend, I upgraded from an iPhone 4 on AT&T to an iPhone 4S on Verizon. For the most part, I've been happy with it. But I did have to fix a couple problems. Here are the problems I had, and the solutions I found.

### Contact names not showing up for text messages or incoming calls

My wife, myself, and [several other people](https://discussions.apple.com/message/16372713) had this issue. Fortunately there's a solution:

> 1. Open the Phone and dial \*228. This is a Verizon over-the-air programming number.
> 2. When the system answer press 1 for "Program or activate your phone"
> 3. Wait for the call to disconnect. You should get a prompt stating something like, "Settings updated."
> 4. Open the Task Manager and kill the Phone, Message, and Contacts Applications
> 5. Wait a few minutes (I waited 3 just to be extra safe)
> 6. Open the Message App to verify the fix.
>    If you are still broken, kill the Message App again, then reboot your phone.

### Siri having trouble connecting to the network

Before you try this, be aware that your phone will reboot immediately, and that you'll lose your saved wi-fi networks and passwords.

> Launch the Settings.app, go into the General tab followed by the Reset tab and tap the Reset Network Settings button

If that doesn't work, try this [more detailed solution](http://www.ijailbreak.com/how-to/fix-siri-not-working-problem/).
